# CVA
Code for Crystallographic Vorticity Axis analysis

The provided code snippets and functions can be run in MATLAB and are written to
leverage functionality from the open source toolbox, MTEX, v4.X+ and (which
provides tools for importing EBSD data and constructing GrainSet objects). Some
details about the CVA method (and appropriate references) are provided in
comments within the functions.

Please contact Z.Michels with any questions or for consultation and feel free to
modify these functions as allowed by the MIT open source license guidelines.
Additionally, older versions of the code are available for use with MTEX v3.5
upon request; however, these have been removed from the repository and are no
longer being maintained.
