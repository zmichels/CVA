%% ABOUT:
% This function performs a principal geodesic analysis on crystallographic
% orientations extracted from a single grain to identify a grain-scale
% vorticity vector associated with intragranular crystallographic
% dispersion. 

% input:
%                       ori     -   set of orientations

% output:
%                        eV     -   eigenvectors of PGA result
%                      mags     -   magnitudes of the eigenvectors
    

%% INTRODUCTION:
%   It has been observed that intragranular crystallographic dispersion
% axes can reflect the orientation of bulk vorticity in geologically
% deformed crystalline materials (Bestmann & Prior, 2003; Reddy & Buchan,
% 2005). We show that the coordinates of such rotational axes can be fit
% numerically for each grain in a sample and assembled to determine a
% preferred sample-scale vorticity axis.
%   The general approach in the following intragranular analysis can be
% applied to any set of concentrated orientation data. However, the
% following code is designed to accommodate electron backscatter
% diffraction data processed through the MTEX texture analysis toolbox for
% Matlab. Specifically, this function requires input of a single MTEX grain
% object (usually passed to the function from a larger MTEX GrainSet).
% Grain objects passed to this function must contain multiple orientation
% solutions for successful analysis.
