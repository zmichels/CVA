%% ABOUT:
% This function performs a principal geodesic analysis on crystallographic
% orientations extracted from a single grain to identify a grain-scale
% vorticity vector associated with intragranular crystallographic
% dispersion.

% input:
%                       ori     -   set of orientations

% output:
%                        eV     -   eigenvectors of dispersion tensor
%                      mags     -   magnitudes of the eigenvectors
%                         T     -   Dispersion tensor
    
% Prinicipal Geodesic Analysis is used to conduct a principal component
% analysis on sets of orientations/rotations. The result of the analysis
% is a covariance/dispersion matrix/tensor.
